Semantic analysis is the process of analysing the semantic of a text, i.e. determining the meaning of the text and analysing it. To measure the semantics
of a text, certain semantic measures have been developed. According to
the literature of natural language processing, semantic measure can be
any theoretical tool, mathematical function, algorithm or approach which
enables the comparison of semantic entities according to semantic evidence.
Following are the semantic proxies used for semantic measures:<br>
* Corpora of texts - It consists of unstructured or semi-structured
texts. These texts contain informal evidence of semantic relationships.
For example text, dictionaries, etc.
* Ontologies - It consists of a large range of knowledge models i.e. structured vocabularies, highly formal ontologies, etc.
For semantic analysis of narrative texts, we are extracting a list of keywords
from a text that is semantically similar to that text.
